# INFSCI 2560 Final Project - Web application: Pittsburgh Forum

Enmin Li, Yunpeng Guo, Zhen Yang, Zijun Zong

## 1.Introduction

Our team developed a web forum named “Pittsburgh Forum” for people to share their great ideas and thoughts whenever they want to. Team members include: Enmin Li (enl29), Yunpeng Guo (yug64), Zhen Yang (zhy84), Zijun Zong (ziz66).

## 2.Objective

Sometimes people are tired of the entertainment news and recommendations that they are not interested in, which could make up more than half of the front pages of social media. To build a purer forum and encourage the communication among users, the “Pittsburgh Forum” is put forward, which acts as a simplified version of microblog that only preserves the posting blog and comments functions.

To start with, a user needs to register for an account. The registration is quite simple since the user only needs to complete a form that requires a username and a password. After logging in, the users would be able to post blogs with images and texts, and browse all blogs posted by other people. Also, the user could interact with others by posting a comment or “like” a post.

The design of the website layout used high contrast colors to emphasize the topic of the blogs and enhance the connections among users. It has a black background with white topic titles so that the users could easily find what they are interested in. The username of each post or comment is highlighted with light blue. The views is designed to be fluorescent green, and the number of “like” is represented with the same color as the red heart logo next to it. These features would stick out of the dark background of the website.

## 4. Technical Architecture
The Pittsburgh forum is developed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure and utilizes several different technologies, including:<br>
1.Node.js and Express, which are used to build the server-side of the application and handle routing, request processing, and other back-end tasks.<br>
2.A templating system like EJS, which is used to generate dynamic HTML pages based on data from the server.<br>
3.MongoDB, which is used to store the forum's data and provide access to it for the application.<br>
4.JavaScript, which is used to enhance interactions and provide a more dynamic user experience.<br>
5.RESTful Web service API, which is used to enable communication and data exchange between the application and other systems or services.<br>
<br>
In terms of how these technologies are put together, the MVC conceptual model can provide a useful guide. In this model, the application is divided into three main components:<br>
1.The model, which represents the data and business logic of the application. In the case of this forum, the model would include the data stored in MongoDB and the rules and algorithms that govern how this data is manipulated and accessed.<br>
2.The view, which represents the user interface of the application. In the case of this forum, the view would be the HTML pages generated by the EJS templating system and the JavaScript code that enhances these pages.<br>
3.The controller, which acts as the intermediary between the model and the view. In the case of this forum, the controller would be the code in the Node.js and Express server-side application that handles incoming requests, retrieves data from the model, and passes it to the view to be rendered.<br>

## 5. Challenges
There are challenges that we have faced while developing this app include:<br>
1.Ensuring that the different components of the application work together seamlessly and are able to communicate and exchange data efficiently.<br>
2.Managing the complexity of the application as it grows and adding new features without introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.<br>
3.Dealing with performance issues and scalability challenges, especially if the forum becomes popular and attracts a large number of users.<br>
<br>
There are some features we  may couldn't get working:<br>
1.Working with large or complex datasets, which can be challenging to manage and manipulate efficiently using traditional database technologies.<br>
2.Implementing security measures to protect the application and its users from potential threats like hacking or data breaches.<br>
3.Integrating the application with external systems or services, like social media platforms or payment gateways, which can be challenging due to differences in APIs and data formats.<br>
## 6. Future Work
There are several features that we will add to our application in the future.<br>
1.User authentication and authorization to ensure that only registered users can access certain parts of the forum and perform certain actions.<br>
2.A messaging or chat system that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time.<br>
3.A search function that allows users to search for specific topics or posts within the forum.<br>
4.A notification system that alerts users when someone has responded to their post or mentioned them in a comment.<br>
5.A points or rewards system that rewards users for contributing to the forum and encourages them to participate more actively.<br>
6.Integration with social media platforms to allow users to share posts and content from the forum on their own social media accounts.<br>
<br>
If we had more time,we’d like to learn the following technologies:<br>
1.Machine learning and natural language processing to enhance the forum's search function and enable it to understand and respond to user queries in a more intelligent way.<br>
2.Web scraping and data mining techniques to collect data from other online sources and incorporate it into the forum.<br>
3.Virtual or augmented reality technologies to create immersive and interactive learning experiences for users.<br>
4.Blockchain technology to create a secure and decentralized platform for storing user data and facilitating transactions within the forum.<br>

## 7. Conclusion 
There are several technologies or standards that we think would be useful in future iterations of this course:<br>
1.Responsive web design techniques ensure that websites are optimized for viewing on a wide range of devices and screen sizes.<br>
2.Advanced CSS technologies such as flex box and grid layout can be used to create complex and flexible page layouts.<br>
3.JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue. js, which can help streamline the development of dynamic and interactive web applications.<br>
4. Serverless computing and cloud-based services like AWS Lambda, which can be used to build scalable and cost-effective web applications.<br>
5. Web accessibility standards and best practices can help ensure that websites are accessible to users with disabilities.<br>
Generally speaking, the field of web development is constantly developing, and new technologies and standards are always emerging. Therefore, for web development courses, it is very important to update the courses regularly and incorporate the latest technologies and standards. <br>
